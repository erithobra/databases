# Relational Database Modeling

## Objectives

- Describe the relationship between tables, rows, and columns.
- Draw entity relationship diagrams with crow's foot notation.
- Describe how tables relate to each other using foreign keys.
- Explain the different relationship types â€“ has_many_through, has_and_belongs_to_many, belongs_to.

## Relationships - Whiteboard Demo (15 mins)

> Note: Use the author/book/category example tables you've drawn to demonstrate creating relationships by making an ERD on the whiteboard; you should use crow's foot notation, making a point to demonstrate it on the board with our existing table drawings

Relationships happen when we start seeing multiple duplicative information or when one object needs to "connect" to another object.

There are 3 different kinds:

### One to One
- not frequently used, but important to know it's an option
- imagine a Library table ```has_one``` location, and a location ```belongs_to``` a specific library - that lets us look up solely by location, and see the connected library
- often, in situations like that, you can make the location an attribute of the library, but when a location has, for example, multiple fields (address 1, address 2, state, zip, etc.), it might make sense to create another table for addresses and set up a ```has_one``` relationship

### One to Many
- the most common type of database relationship
- an author ```has_many``` books, but a book ```belongs_to``` only one author

### Many to Many
- also very frequent
- a book probably "has many" categories, and a category also probably "has many" books

Keep in mind, the ```belongs_to``` part always goes on the opposite side of the ```has_many``` or ```has_one```. And the way it's stored is that the ID of the model that "has" something is stored in a field on the child, like "customer_id" or "author_id".  In our example with authors and books, the Book model ```belongs_to``` the Author model, while the Author, as mentioned, ```has_many``` books.

## Independent Practice (20 minutes)

 Working with a partner, draw out some Entity Relation Diagrams like we have on the board, with crow's foot notation like we have.

 Try drawing one (or more, if you're fast) of the following:

 - A social media site, with users and posts/tweets/pins
 - An online ordering system, with customers and orders
 - A bar drink system, with orders, customers, drinks, and/or liquors

## Conclusion (5 mins)
- How do you represent a relational database in drawings? How would you describe the metaphor of storing data like a spreadsheet?
- What are the three types of relationships, and what are some examples of how you would you use them?
